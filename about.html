								<p>The vision and mandate of The King’s Village Oasis of Love Orphanage was born out of personal relationship with The Lord Jesus Christ. The establishment and operation of the orphanage is a practical product of hearing and obeying the voice (word) of The Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
								<p>On the 6th of March, 2007, the orphanage was established in a rented apartment with just one child and in less than 3 month, 4 more children were added to the home. Presently, more than 70 children have been added to the home some have reunited to their relatives but a total of 61 children are still resident in the orphanage, 41 of these children are in secondary school and the other 20 are undergoing their primary education. One of the children under a different program is in the Tertiary Institution. We are also setting up a skills acquisition for our children.</p>

								<h2><span>OUR </span> STORY</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="full">
								<p>The vision of The King’s Village Oasis of Love Orphanage was born out of a personal relationship between The Lord Jesus Christ and the leading servant of Jesus is Lord Project Mercy Ministry [JILPMM], Mrs AnnMary Ndubuisi Amene. </p>
								<p>She developed her commitment to the Lord in her early teenage years as a student of St Louis College Bompai, Kano – Nigeria, where her compassion for children and passion for raising godly households was stirred up. Her experience as a teacher, a wife, and a mother further strengthened her commitment for godly training of children.</p>
								<p>After her retirement as a teacher she was nursing the dream of setting up a private school, where her wealth of experience would yield profits but while she was brooding over the idea one of her past students, who was praying received a message from The Lord for her saying “TELL MY DAUGHTER THAT SHE SHOULD GIVE UP THAT SCHOOL WHICH SHE HAS BEEN DREAMING OF. INSTEAD SHE SHOULD GO AND BUILD AN ORPHANAGE, TELL HER TO SET OUT THE PLAN AND EVERYTHING THE WAY IT SHOULD BE, TELL HER NOT TO WORRY BUT TO LOOK UNTO ME, I WILL CAUSE MEN TO SOW INTO HER LIFE” </p>
								<p>By the time she finished reading the message, The Leading Servant was shocked and was quiet. The messenger did not understand the long silence and asked, “Mummy are you dreaming of building a school?”  The leading servant then said to the messenger - “Exactly at 7pm yesterday, if you had been here, you would have heard me grumbling about my mates doing business while I am running ministry - This message is from the Lord”</p>
								<p>The messenger confessed that she had received the message one month before she delivered it to the leading servant (it took a query from her husband whether she had delivered the message telling her that God would hold her responsible if she did not deliver the message). Only 24hours of the leading servant’s complaint and God showed up by ensuring that the message was delivered to her.</p>
								<p>In seeking confirmation from The Lord about the message The Leading Servant decided to take time off to hear God personally about the matter. She went to the Daughters of Charity at Eleme – Rivers State (Nigeria) and they gave her a room to stay. She spent six days praying and listening to hear anything from The Lord about the matter but heard nothing, Instead The Lord spoke to her about supporting the Youth With A Mission YWAM coming to Nigeria for the very first time in 2001.</p>
								<p>On the seventh day, she told The Lord She was leaving, and feeling very upset and while packing up her stuff, she heard “take up your pen and paper and write”. Then The Lord started to speak to the Leading Servant like a dictation. “Take care of the needs of orphans, That land (2 plots at that time) you have at Oyigbo – Rivers State, that is the orphanage…” (Today God has given us over a hundred plots at the same place). This is why the King’s Village values; The Lordship of Jesus Christ; Stewardship of Resources, Servant Leadership; Hearing and obeying the voice of The Lord, Faithfulness in little things, Total dependence on The Lord. </p>
								<p>There are many proofs of the infallible nature of the word of The Lord unto us in The King’s Village, which goes a very long way to assure us of The Lord’s Commitment to us as “His Exclusive Preserve”. One of latest among them was the flood that ravaged many homes and routes around our environment in 2019, The flood was already encroaching into our premises at the back and had affected a lot of activities (in fact many people around us were rendered homeless) including schools that shut down and guests could not visit. While our leading Servant was groaning about the matter, the same messenger who had no clue called all the way from Abuja in the Northern part of Nigeria and delivered the message she received in her time with The Lord from <strong>ISAIAH 44:24, 27 “ This is what the LORD says – your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the LORD, the Maker of all things, who stretches out the heavens, who spreads out the earth by myself, that says to the deep, be dry, and I will dry up your rivers” </strong></p>
								<p>Then the leading servant understood that The Lord was speaking to us about the flood and true to His word, the flood never affected The King’s Village until it dried up. Hallelujah! God’s has been faithful to His word in The King’s Village in every aspect of life. Indeed He is worthy to receive honour, praise, worship, thanksgiving, and adoration. </p>
